\subsection{Speed Monitor}

The following channel is used to communicate the current speed from the speed monitor ($SpeedMonitor$ process) to the throttle controller executive ($ThrottleControl$ process).
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannel ~ get\_current\_speed : \nat
\end{circus}

\subsection{Speed Monitor Timing}

The following channel is used by the process that specifies the speed monitor to generate periodic events that trigger re-calculation of the speed current.
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannel ~ update\_speed
\end{circus}

\subsection{Throttle Control}

\nid The following four channels are used by the state machine to interact with the throttle controller. They reflect the actions of entering cruise mode, exiting cruise mode, entering acceleration mode, and exiting acceleration mode, respectively. We do not give an action for $resume$ as $activate$ can be used here.
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannel ~ activate
  \also
  \circchannel ~ deactivate
  \also
  \circchannel ~ start\_accelerate
  \also
  \circchannel ~ stop\_accelerate
\end{circus}
%
We note that the underlying functions of these events are triggered asynchronously, hence the events correspond to \emph{requests} of enter the particular mode. The throttle control executive does not block any of these events at any time.

% Obsolete since we introduced two new events $start\_accelerate$ and $stop\_accelerate$.
%
%\begin{circus}
%  \circchannel ~ accelerate
%\end{circus}

\subsection{Throttle Timing}

In order to specify the behavioural and timing requirements of the throttle, we require an internal channel that initiates a write of the throttle voltage.
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannel ~ write\_voltage
\end{circus}
%
We note that the specification of timing requirements, specifically the $ThrottleTiming$ process, enforces that there is no delay between $write\_voltage$ and a subsequent $set\_voltage~.~v$ event. This means we can use $write\_voltage$ to express that $set\_voltage~.~v$ must occur exactly at that time.

\subsection{Channel Sets}

We first define channel sets for the individual specification components.
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannelset SpeedMonitorEvents ~ == ~ \lchanset get\_current\_speed \rchanset
  \also

  \circchannelset ThrottleControlEvents ~ == ~ \lchanset activate, deactivate, start\_accelerate, stop\_accelerate \rchanset
  \also

  \circchannelset ThrottleTimingEvents ~ == ~ \lchanset write\_voltage \rchanset
\end{circus}

\nid The channel set $SpecificationEvents$ contains all internal events that are used between the components.
%
\begin{circus}
  \circchannelset SpecificationEvents ~ ==\\
  \t1 SpeedMonitorEvents \cup ThrottleControlEvents \cup ThrottleTimingEvents
\end{circus}
