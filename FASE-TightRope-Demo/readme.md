TightRope v0.6 Demo
=======

FASE - A Formal Model of the Safety-Critical Java Level 2 Paradigm
-----------

### Tool Demo

The TightRope tool demo is configured to translate the FlatBuffer example application described in our paper 'A Formal Model of the Safety-Critical Java Level 2 Paradigm'.

To run the TightRope tool demo:
  1. enter the 'FASE-TightRope-Demo/too' directory and open a terminal
  2. use `ant` to compile the tool (this step may not be needed)
  3. use `./run TightRope` to run the TightRope demo

The the resulting model will be written to 'FASE-TightRope-Demo/output'. The individual files can be examined, and TightRope produces a PDF report of the model.

### Folders

'FlatBuffer Program' contains the source files of the FlatBuffer.
'output' is the folder to where TightRope will write the model.
'packages' contains the LaTeX style files needed for the report.
'templates' contains the templates used to output the model.
'tool' contains the TightRope tool and the application it is built upon.

### Caveats and Addenda

  1. This tool has only been tested on Linux
  2. TightRope assumes that it can access pdsltex at: '/usr/bin/pdflatex'
  3. TightRope v0.6 is *only* configured to translate the FltBuffer application
  4. TightRope is not yet fully complete and may contain some bugs, etc
  5. This tool is adapted from a preexisting tool for translating SCJ Level 1 programs. We claim no ownership of their work and thank them for kindly providing us with the source code
