A customized and fixed version of the Purdue CD benchmark.  This version is
intended to be SCJ-compliant.  It is impossible to know for sure, as there
is no SCJ-compliant implementation at the moment.  There also may be bugs.

Most of the code can run with the RI, but not all. It has to be slightly
modified for the RI.

Both L0 and L1 should be supported - cdx.Level0Safelet and cdx.Level1Safelet
