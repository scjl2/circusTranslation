NOTES
=====

Ant:

(*) The following causes Ant not to print out lines for targets not fired:

    ant -logger org.apache.tools.ant.NoBannerLogger <...>

(*) The Ant option -e or -emacs suppresses the leading [...] when logging task execution.

Java API:

(*) The visitor for Element structures does not traverse local variables.

 -> They are actually not represented my the model (?).
